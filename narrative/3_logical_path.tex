\section{Logical path to accomplishing scope}

This project has two primary tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item developing an open, collaborative benchmark framework allowing real
  inter-code comparison, and
\item using this framework to understand what modeling fidelity is required to
  ensure the robustness of conclusions for different fuel cycle scenarios.
\end{enumerate}
